## Project infos

* **Duration:** 3 days
* **Deadline:** 11 february 2021, 17:00
* **Team challenge:** solo

## Objectives

* Manipulate Laravel and Jetstream
* Use CRUD for library and members
* Manage administrators and simple members
* Make suggestions using book genres

## What did I use?

* Laravel with Jetstream

## How did I do it?

I searched informations on MVC, OOP and routes. These research helped me to understand Laravel architecture.

Many Google search and more screams.

## What works?

Administrators have all the rights. They create a new book entry, edit a book and delete a book. They have access to the members list.

Users have only access to the books list and... that's it.

## What can be improved?

* It's not pretty and the Laravel basic style is everywhere.
* The membres CRUD for the administrators is not finished.
* The suggestions system isn't even started.

## Conclusion

Laravel is not simple at all and the syntax is difficult to grasp. I think that with practice, it's a really uselful tool.

## Login infos for test
* admin@librarybecode.be -> superbecode
* user@random.be -> randomuser
